# A/V Setup at 2019 Venues

**All speakers**: please bring your laptop and charger. Our current set of cables and adapters supports HDMI, Mini DisplayPort, or USB-C; if your laptop's display output is something else, please let us know so we can order an adapter.

## Catalyst HTI
Catalyst has a built-in projection and sound system. We'll provide HDMI adapters to connect you to the projector, and a mic to connect you to the sound system.

## The Source Hotel
The Source Hotel also has a built-in projector and sound system. They use a system called "ClickShare" to connect to the projector. Basically you plug in a USB dongle, and you're good to go. We'll provide USB-C adapters, but otherwise if you have a USB port you're good.

## Big Trouble
If you attended last year, the setup at Big Trouble will be different than what we had then. We're moving to the back of the upstairs space, and using standalone TVs and speakers. We'll have adapters for the TVs, and a handheld or wearable microphone for the speaker.

## Bigsby's Folly
Bigsby's Folly has a built-in projector and sound system. We'll provide HDMI adapters to connect you to the projector, and a mic to connect you to the sound system.

## Helikon Gallery
At Helikon we'll be providing two TVs so we can stagger them through the audience, as well as a speaker and a microphone.
